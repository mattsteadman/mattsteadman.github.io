My name is Matt Steadman. I currently work as a data engineer, writing data pipelines in Python. I previously worked at CNC machine manufacturer, first programming industrial controllers in C, and then working on data analytics libraries in R. In college, I studied electrical engineering, mostly focusing on analog electronic design.
