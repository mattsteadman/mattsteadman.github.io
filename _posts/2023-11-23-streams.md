One of the most interesting concepts in computer science to me is the concept of a stream. They are such useful abstractions that they appear in many different contexts
- In Unix, streams are used as an I/O abstraction. Everyone knows that `stdin` and `stdout` are streams, but even files are managed as streams when you use formatted I/O functions like `fprintf()`
- In Scheme, streams are just lazy lists. This is useful for writing functions which manipulate large (or infinite) lists. You can get the result of a computation on part of your list without doing any more work than necessary.
- The data in log-based message brokers like Kafka are often thought of as a stream (and computation on it is referred to as stream processing)
- A stream is the core metaphor behind TCP communication
- On Unix, in addition to the `STREAM`` datatype, I/O communication in general (including over TCP sockets) is thought of as reading and writing to a stream. Most interprocess communication, whether over sockets or pipes, is through this abstraction.

In fact, you might choose to extend the concept of a stream to include a broader category of programming abstractions like queues, messages, events and even asynchrony. Insofar as streams are about incremental computation, all these other concepts can used to support similar data models to streams.
