Here's fizzbuzz in one line of Python:

{% highlight python %}
print('/n'.join([('Fizz' * (i % 3 == 0) 
                    + 'buzz' * (i % 5 == 0)) 
                or str(i) 
                for i in range(1,101)])) 
{% endhighlight %}

This illustrates several interesting features of Python:
- When you apply `*` to a `str` and `int`, you will get the `str` repeated the number of times of the `int`
    - When you apply `*` to a `str` by a `bool`, it will give you either `0` or `1` copies of the `str`, because `bool` is a subclass of `int` in Python
- When you apply `+` to two `str`s, you get the `str`s concatenated together
- You can `or` together `str`s and they will be interpreted based on Python [truthiness](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing) rules. That is, an empty string is `False` and everything else is `True`.
    - Furthermore, the [result](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not) of `or`ing together any data types will *not* always be `True` or `False`, but one of the *inputs* of the `or` expression. `x or y` really means `x if x else y`.
