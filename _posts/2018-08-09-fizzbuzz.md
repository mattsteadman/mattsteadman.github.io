Here's fizzbuzz in one line of Python:

```py
print('/n'.join(['Fizz' * (i % 3 == 0) + 'buzz' * (i % 5 == 0) or str(i) for i in range(1,101)])) 
```

This illustrates several interesting features of Python:
- When you multiple a `str` and `int`, you will get a `str` repeated the number of times of the `int`
- Addition of `str`s is concatenation
- You can `or` together `str`s and they will be interpreted based on Python [truthiness](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing) rules
- Furthermore, the [result](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not) of `or`ing together any data types will *not* always be *True* or *False*, but one of the *inputs* of the `or` expression.
