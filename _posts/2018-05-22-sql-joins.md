*Join predicate* - The condition specified after `ON` in a `JOIN` statement

## Cross Join
Like the Cartesain product of rows from the tables in the join.

Explicit: 
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee CROSS JOIN department;
{% endhighlight %}

Implicit:
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee, department;
{% endhighlight %}

## Inner Join
Joins the intersection between the two columns in the joined tables

Explicit (`INNER` is optional):
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID, department.DepartmentName 
FROM employee 
INNER JOIN department ON
employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID
{% endhighlight %}
Implicit:
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee, department
WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}

### Equi-join
A type of inner join where the join predicate looks like `a.c = b.c`. In this case, `ON a.c = b.c` can be replaced with `USING (c)`. An inner join with an `a.c = b.c` join predicate is called an equi-join whether or not the `USING` notation is used.

Example: 
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee INNER JOIN department USING (DepartmentID);
{% endhighlight %}

#### Natural join:
- A special case of an equi-join. It is the "natural" way to join two tables that include common column names. The natural join of two tables R and S is the set of all combinations of rows in R and S that are equal on their common column ("attribute") names.
- Natural join is the relational counterpart to a logical `AND`.
- A natural join doesn't require a join predicate, because it uses common column names as the implicit predicate.
- Natural joins are considered harmful, because inadvertantly naming two unrelated columns the same in two different tables can create unintented effects.

The syntax for a natural join is:
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee NATURAL JOIN department;
{% endhighlight %}

## Outer Join
An outer join will retain rows that don't satisfy the join-predicate, leaving some rows `NULL`.

A `LEFT` outer join will retain rows in the table on the left side of the `JOIN` keyword
A `RIGHT` outer join will retain rows in the table to the right side of the `JOIN` keyword.
A `FULL` outer join will retain rows in the tables on both sides of the `JOIN` keyword.

You can also call these a left join, right join, full join.

There is no implicit notation for outer joins.

Left Outer
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee LEFT OUTER JOIN department 
  ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}

Right Outer
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee RIGHT OUTER JOIN department
  ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}

Full Outer
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
FROM employee FULL OUTER JOIN department
  ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
{% endhighlight %}
